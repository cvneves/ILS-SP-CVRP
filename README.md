# ILSSP-CVRP
This is a reimplementation of the ILSSP matheuristic [[1](#1), [3](#3)] for solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. The method relies in the Iterated Local Search matheuristic for constructing good solutions whose routes are feeded to a pool. Routes from the pool are then chosen by using an exact procedure in an attempt to construct obtain better solutions. 

In its current state, the method is aimed specifically at the canonical version of the problem, which considers only the vehicle capacities. In addition, slight modifications were made to the previously cited versions in order to address the more recent benchmark set proposed by [[2](#2)]. Some of the changes include recalibration in parameters such as the number of iterations and pool acceptance tolerance, as well as attending the new standard of unrestricted vehicles in the solutions.

### Requirements and usage
Both GCC 9.4.0 and [IBM CPLEX 20.1](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) are required to compile the code. The latter may be obtained freely through an academic license. The makefile is configured to import the CPLEX libraries from their default installation folder (`/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_StudioXXX`). Nevertheless, importing them from a different folder, as well as using prior versions of the solver, should require minor changes in the makefile only.

Once the repository is cloned, compile the code by going to the `ILSSP` directory and using the `make` command. Finally, enter the command
```sh
./rvrp.out ../Instances/instance_name.vrp
```
to run.
