# ILSSP-CVRP
A matheuristic approach for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem. Test [[1]](#1). Sei [[2]](#2).

### Requirements and usage
Both GCC 9.4.0 and [IBM CPLEX 20.1](https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio) are required to compile the code. The latter may be obtained freely through an academic license. The makefile is configured to import the CPLEX libraries from their default installation folder (`/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_StudioXXX`). Nevertheless, importing them from a different folder, as well as using prior versions of the solver, should require minor changes in the makefile only.

Once this repository is cloned, the code should be compiled by 

```
make
./rvrp.out instance_name
```
